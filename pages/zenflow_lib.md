**Core Architecture Ideas:**

- Create a plugin manifest system where each module declares its dependencies, outputs, and configuration options
- Implement a dependency resolver that automatically loads required modules when others need them
- Build a simple package manager that can fetch, update, and manage modules from various sources

**Module Categories to Consider:**

- System monitoring (CPU, RAM, disk usage, temperature)
- Network tools (VPN status, network speed, ping monitoring)
- Media controls (current playing song, volume slider)
- Calendar/time modules (world clocks, upcoming events)
- Development tools (git branch, build status, container status)
- Weather and location services
- Cryptocurrency/stock tickers
- Custom command outputs with formatting

**Template System Enhancements:**

- Support for conditional rendering based on system state
- Theme inheritance where modules can adapt to global color schemes
- Variable interpolation from config files or environment
- Support for animations and transitions between states
- Multi-format output (JSON, plain text, markup) depending on the bar system

**User Experience Features:**

- A `--dry-run` mode to test configurations without applying them
- Built-in validation that checks template syntax before deployment
- A simple TUI for browsing and configuring available modules
- Auto-backup of working configurations before applying changes
- Module marketplace/registry with ratings and usage stats

**Technical Implementation Ideas:**

- Use a lightweight templating engine like Handlebars or Mustache
- Implement module sandboxing to prevent broken modules from crashing the whole bar
- Create a unified logging system where all modules can report errors
- Support for both polling-based and event-driven module updates
